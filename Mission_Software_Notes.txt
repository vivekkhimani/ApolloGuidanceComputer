***** MISSION SOFTWARE *****

1) USER INTERFACE: 
- DSKY user interface which stands for Display and Keyboard. 
- It had an array of indicator lights, numeric display,  and a calculator style keyboard.
- Commands were entered numerically- as TWO DIGITS number, each representing a VERB and a NOUN.
- VERB- Type of Action to be Performed; NOUN- which data was affected by the action specified by the VERB command. 
- The numerals were display using gree high-voltage electroluminescent seven-segment displays.

EXAMPLE:
-verb- 01 (#DISPLAY); noun- 02 (#MEMORY);
-THE AGC WILL START FLASHING VERB AND NOUN TO SHOW THAT IT IS WAITING FOR THE INPUT (FOR EXAMPLE YOU INPUT 25). 
-THE AGC DISPLAYS RESULT WHICH DISPLAYS MEMORY AT THE OCTAL ADDRESS- 25  


-THERE ARE SPECIAL CASES WHICH CAN BE EXECUTED BY ENTERING THE VERB, AND THE AGC FLASHES AND ASKS FOR THE CONFIRMATION (YES/NO). THE YES OR NO RESPONSE IS REPRESENTED BY THE NOUN.
- EXAMPLE: VERB #99 ASKS ASTRONAUT FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF ENGINE IGNITIONB. 
-THERE IS A WHOLE SPECIAL LIST OF VERBS AND NOUNS CORRESPONDING TO DIFFERENT NUMBERS AND EXECUTING UNIQUE FUNCTIONS FOR THE APOLLO GUIDANCE COMPUTER. 



*/*/*/*/*DETAILS OF FUNCTIONING OF MISSION SOFTWARE ON AGC IN DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE MISSION */*/*/*/*/

A. LIFT OFF/ LAUNCH --- 
- THE MISSION CLOCK IS SET TO ZERO OR BEGINS WHEN THE CABLES ON THE BOTTOM PART OF THE SPACECRAFT ARE CUT OFF AND IT LIFTS UP. IF THE TRIGGER FAILS THIS MANUAL COMMAND IS USED.
- VERB #75- IS USED TO MANUALLY SET MISSION CLOCK TO ZERO AS SOON AS THE SPACECRAFT LIFTS UP. (MISSION ELAPSE TIME)
- VERB #16, NOUN #65- MONITORS THE MISSION TIME IN HOURS, MINUTES, AND SECONDS. 
- AFTER THIS POINT, THE AGC IS ONLY PERFORMING PASSIVE MONITORING OF THE FLIGHT (EARTH ORBIT INSERTION MONITORING PROGRAM--- THE PROCESS DURING WHICH SPACECRAFT IS LAUNCHED IN EARTH ORBIT).
- VERB #16, NOUN #62- IS USED FOR PASSIVE MONITORING (MONITORS INERTIAL VELOCITY MAGNITUDE IN FEET/S, RATE OF CHANGE OF ALTITUDE IN FEET/S, AND ALTITUDE ABOVE PATTERN NAUTICAL MILES)
- THE UNITS WERE FUNCTIONING PERFECTLY INTERNALLY, BUT FOR THE BENEFITS OF AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS THE DISPLAY PROCEDURES CONVERTED EVERYTHING INTO DIFFERENT UNITS. 
- VERB #16, NOUN #46- IN CASE OF ANY PROBLEM THE COMPLETE CONTROL IS SHIFTED TO AGC, FROM SATURN COMPUTER IN THE LAUNCH VEHICLE. AND IN EXTREME CASES ASTRONAUTS CAN SHIFT 
COMPLETE CONTROL TO THE MANUAL OPERATION. 

B. LANDING INTO THE EARTH ORBIT:
- THE AGC COMMANDS HELP US TO PASSIVELY MONITOR THE FLIGHT IN TERMS OF VELOCITY, ALTITUDE, AND NAUTICAL MILES. 
- BUT TO LAND IN THE CORRECT EARTH ORBIT AND TO KNOW IF IT IS THE CORRECT EARTH ORBIT, WE NEED AGC TO MONITOR THE STATE VECTOR WHICH HELPS US TO LOCATE THE
CORRECT ORBIT.
- STATE VECTOR (VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR TO NAVIGATE IN THE SPACE) CONSISTS OF---- THREE DIMENSIONAL POSITION VECTOR AND THREE DIMENSIONAL VELOCITY VECTOR. 
- MEASUREMENT OF POSITION VECTOR:
	: DONE WITH THE HELP OF TELESCOPE AND A SPACE SEXTONT.
	: SPACE SEXTONT: POSITION IS MEASURED BY MEASURING THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE HORIZONT AND THE CELLESTIAL BODY. 
	: HORIZONT COULD BE TAKEN EITHER OF THE EARTH OR A MOON AND AS THE EARTH ORBIT IS SURROUNDED BY A LOT OF CELLESTIAL BODY SO WE CAN PICK ANY WHICH IS KNOWN BY AGC (IT KNOWS 45 OF THEM).
	: THE OPTICS HARDWARE IN THE CSM CAN BE POINTED TOWARDS THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE EARTH OR THE MOON.  
	: COMMAND THE AGC TO POINT ONE AXIS OF THE SEXTONT TO THE NEAREST BODY (EARTH OR MOON).
	: THE ASTRONAUTS USE OPTIC SYSTEM TO EXACTLY ALIGN THE HORIZONT TO THAT EXACT DIRECTION OF AXIS.
	: WITH THE TELESCOPE ASTRONAUTS LOOK AT ONE OF THE KNOWN CELLESTIAL BODY AND LET AGC TO LOCATE THE POSITION OF THAT BODY AND CALCULATE THE ANGLE BETWEEN HORIZONT AND BODY.
	: REPEATING THIS ONE OR MORE TIME IN DIFFERENT PLANES GIVES THE THREE DIMENSIONAL POSITION VECTOR REQUIRED IN THE STATE VECTOR. 
	
- THE OPTIC HARDWARE ON THE LUNAR MODULE (LM) ON THE OTHER HAND WAS TRIMMED DOWN FOR WEIGHT REDUCTION BECAUSE ANY ALIGNMENT REQUIRES THE ROTATION OF THE LUNAR MODULE. AND THIS
IS MOSTLY USED TO DETERMINE THE LANDING SIGHT AND SUPPORT THE RANZDEVEOUS MANEUVEUR.  
- THE LUNAR MODULE (LM) ALSO LACKS THE SOFTWARE TO PERFORM POSITIONING IN THE TRANSLUNAR SPACE.
- ONCE WE ARE IN THE EARTH ORBIT (CIRCULAR) AND MOVING AROUND, THE POSITION CHANGES ALL THE TIME.
- BUT ONCE THE CONSTANT SPEED IS ESTABLISHED AND WITH THE HELP OF TWO POSITION FIXES, WE CAN ESTABLISH THE FUTURE POSITIONING WITH THE HELP OF PRINCIPLE OF DEAD RECKONING. 
- DEAD RECKONING WORKS ON THE BASIS OF EXTRAPOLATION, WHICH DOESN'T WORK IN SPACE BECAUSE THE SURROUNDING ROTATIONAL FORCES BEND OUR PATH (THIS EXPLAINS WHY THEY NEEDED A COMPUTER)
- TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE HAVE TWO MATHEMATICAL MODELS IN THE APOLLO GUIDANCE COMPUTER: 
	A. KEPLER MODEL: THIS IS BASED ON THE INTEGRATING CONICAL SURFACE AND ASSUMES ONE PERFECTLY ROUND BODY INFLUENCING THE PATH OF SPACECRAFT. 
	B. ENCKE MODEL: THIS IS ANOTHER INTEGRATING MODEL FOR PERTUBATION WHICH CONSIDERS MULTIPLE BODIES WITH GRAVITATIONAL INBALANCES. 
*** THIS CLEARLY EXPLAINS THAT WHY DO WE NEED COMPUTER ON-BOARD AND CAN'T JUST FLY TO THE MOON BY HAND CONTROLLER ***
- ALTHOUGH AGC IS CAPABLE TO MEASURE THE STATE VECTOR ON ITS OWN BUT NASA DECIDED THAT PRIMARY SOURCE FOR STATE VECTOR WOULD BE IN HOUSTON WITH THREE GROUND STATIONS. 
- NOUN #27 IS USED BY THE AGC THROUGH WHICH GROUND CONTROL CAN OBTAIN AND COMPARE THE STATE VECTORS ON THE AIRCRAFT. 
- GROUND MISSION CONTROL DOESN'T KNOW THE ATTITUDE OF THE SPACECRAFT AS GOOD AS THE AGC. 

-ATTITUDE IS TO SEE THE ORIENTATION OF SPACECRAFT IN ITS THREE AXIS. STARTING FROM UNKNOWN ATTITUDE WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MEASURE ANY ROTATION ON ANY AXIS. 
- GYROSCOPE (ONE OF THE PERIPHERALS) WAS USED ON THE AGC TO MEASURE THE ATTITUDE OF THE SPACECRAFT AT ANY POINT AND SUPPLY THE DATA TO ASTRONAUTS. 


C. DIGITAL AUTOPILOT:
- THE FEATURE ON AGC WHICH REQUIRED GREATEST PROGRAMMING. 
- IT REQUIRED ALMOST 10% OF THE SOURCE CODE BOTH ON THE CSM AND LM. 
- THE IMPLEMENTATION IN EACH OF THE MODULES ARE DIFFERENT DUE TO DIFFERENT FLIGHT MODES AND DIFFERENT SYMMETRY OF VEHICLE. 
- AS THERE'S NO FRICTION IN SPACE, THE TINIEST EVENT IN THE SURROUNDING WOULD MAKE THE SPACECRAFT CONSTANTLY ROTATE. 
- THE DAP IN APOLLO AIRCRAFT USED JETS TO MAINTAIN THE ATTITUDE OF THE SPACECRAFT.
- IS SOME FEATURE IN THE SPACECRAFT BREAKS AND MALFUNCTIONS, THE DAP HELPS THE ASTRONAUTS TO FLY THE AIRCRAFT MANUALLY BY CALCULATING THE ENGINE BURNS BY SOME SIMPLE
ALGORITHMS RELATED TO THE CENTRE OF THE GRAVITY OF THE SPACECRAFT. 
- THESE BURNS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHILE CALCULATING THRUST AND MANEUVERS WHICH ENABLES THE ASTRONAUTS TO FLY THE AIRCRAFT ON THEIR OWN.
- IT CAN DO MORE. EXAMPLE: VERB #49 AND NOUN #22 WILL BE USED BY THE DAP TO CALCULATE THE MOST EFFICIENT TRANSFER VECTOR TO TRANSFER FROM PRESENT ATTITUDE TO NEW ATTITUDE.
- PROG #20, VERB 379, AND NOUN 379 PROVIDES STABLE ROTATION BY THE AUTOPILOT DURING CERTAIN CONDITIONS. 
- AUTOPILOT ENABLES POWERED FLIGHT BY CERTAIN CALCULATIONS (WHICH ARE MONITORED BY THE GROUND STAFF). BUT AFTER PERMISSION FROM THE GROUND STAFF, AUTOPILOT CAN ACTIVATE
ENGINES AND KEEP IT ON FOR A SPECIFIC TIME. IT DOES NOT CALCULATE THE RESULTS OF THE BURN THOUGH. DEAD RECKONING DOES NOT WORK DURING THE POWERED FLIGHT SO IT TAKES 
INPUTS FROM THE ACCELEROMETER AND GYROSCOPE TO CALCULATE THE CHANGE IN THE STATE VECTOR AND ACCORDINGLY ACTIVATES POWERED FLIGHT. 

D. TRANSLUNAR INJECTION:
- THE PROCESS IN WHICH THE SPACECRAFT WILL BE SET ON A TRAJECTORY WHICH WILL CAUSE IT TO ARRIVE ON THE MOON. 
- THIS IS PRIMARILY DONE BY SATURN V ROCKET SO THE AGC HAS ONCE AGAIN PASSIVE MONITORY ROLE USING DEDICATED PROGRAM P15.
- ONCE THE SPACECRAFT IS ON THE CORRECT TRAJECTORY, IT IS SEPERATED FROM THE SATURN V AND IS SET ON ITS WAY TOWARDS THE MOON.

E. LUNAR LANDING:
- ONCE THE SPACECRAFT ENTERS THE LUNAR ORBIT, THE CSM AND LM HAS TO BE SEPERATED (APPROX 4HRS AND 45MIN BEFORE THE LANDING) OUT OF WHICH LM WILL BE LANDED ON THE MOON
AND CSM WILL STAY ON THE LUNAR ORBIT. ONE ASTRONAUT WILL STAY IN THE CSM WHILE OTHER TWO WILL GO IN THE LM TO THE MOON.
- IT REQUIRES A LOT OF PREPARATION BEFORE LANDING ON THE LUNAR MODULE. 
- RENDEZVOUS EQUIPMENTS LIKE RADAR ARE TESTED AND ACCELEROMETER AND GYROSCOPE (IMU) IS REALIGNED. 
- ONE OF THE PRIMARY PREPARATION IS GETTING READY THE AGC- ABORT GUIDANCE SYSTEM, WHICH IS A SIMPLER COMPUTER WHICH IS ABLE TO GET LUNAR MODULE BACK WITH THE ASTRONAUTS TO JOIN 
THE CSM IN LUNAR ORBIT IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY. 
- THE LUNAR MODULE AND AGS HAS A SPECIAL PROGRAM NAMED P63 (BREAKING PHASE) FOR THE POWER DESCENT ON THE MOON .
- THE LANDING RADAR IS SWITCHED ON AND CONTINUOUSLY UPDATES THE SPACE VECTOR. 
- THE AGC CONTROL THE BURN TO REACH THE CORRECT CORIDOOR ON THE SURFACE WITH THE MINIMUM FUEL. (THIS PROCESS IS FULLY AUTOMATIC AND ASTRONAUTS SIT ALONG FOR A RIDE).
- THE LUNAR MODULE IS ORIENTED WITH ITS ENGINE TOWARDS THE MOON AND VISIBILITY FOR THE ASTRONAUTS IS CLOSE TO ZERO. 
- THE PROGRAM #64 STARTS AUTOMATICALLY AT AROUND 8000 FEET, AND THE LM IS PITCHED AND ASTRONAUTS CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE GROUND AND CAN COMMAND IT TO FIND A SUITABLE SPOT FOR LANDING. 
- THE PROGRAM #68 KEEPS LUNAR MODULE IN STABLE ATTITUDE ABOVE THE SURFACE AND COMMANDER MANUALLY ADJUSTS THE HEIGHT ABOVE THE SURFACE AND SLOWLY DESCENDS TO THE SURFACE.
- AT THIS POINT THE HORIZONTAL MOVEMENT OF LUNAR MODULE SHOULD BE ZERO. AFTER TOUCHDOWN CREW MANUALLY ACTIVATES PROGRAM #68 WHICH SHOWS THE AGC THAT WE HAVE LANDED AND SHOWS
THAT ENGINE IS SWITCHED OFF AND SETS AUTOPILOT IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT LET'S GO ANY CORRECTION IT NOTICES IN THE HORIZONTAL MOVEMENT DUE TO THE ROTATION OF THE MOON BUT IT 
IS NOT COMPLETELY SWITCHED OFF AS THEY MIGHT NEED IT IN THE CASE OF AN EMERGENCY.
/*/*/*/* THEN ASTRONAUTS GO ON THE MOON AND DO USUAL STEPS LIKE PLACING A FLAG AND STUFF*/*/*/

F. LUNAR REDEZVOUS:
- RENDEZVOUS TECHNIQUE WAS DEVELOPED IN THE GEMINI PROJECT
- THE LM FOLLOWS THE CSM AND APPROACHES IT FROM THE BELOW
- THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT WAYS FOR RENDEZVOUS:
	A. COELLIPTIC:
	- MORE CONSERVATIVE METHOD.
	- TAKES 1.5 ORBITS FOR LM TO REACH CSM.
	- THIS LEAVES AMPLE OF OPPORTUINITIES FOR ALIGNMENT AND CORRECTIONS. 

	B. DIRECT:
	- MORE DANGEROUS.
	- TAKES LESS THEN 1 ORBIT AND DIRECTLY AIMS LM TO CSM. 
	- USED FROM APOLLO 14 AS MISSION CONTROL HAD MORE EXPERIENCE AND THIS SAVED A LOT OF FUEL. 

- PREPARATION HAD TO BE STARTED ALMOST TWO HOURS BEFORE THE LIFT OFF. 
- ACTIVATE THE ACCERATOR AND GYROSCOPE (IMU) AND CALCULATE THE ORBIT OF CSM FOR RENDEZVOUS DATA. 
- AGC HAS PROGRAM #22 (CSM TRACKING) FOR THIS PURPOSE. 
- AGC HAS PROGRAM #12 (POWER ASCENT) FOR LIFTOFF (ACTIVATED BEFORE ONE HOUR) TO FEED OFF WITH THE DATA LIKE LIFT OFF TIME, VELOCITY, AND TARGETS. 
- AGC PERFORMS COUNTDOWN AND ASKS FOR CONFIRMATION BEFORE LIFT-OFF. IF WE PROCEED THE LIFT OFF IS PERFORMED. 
- IT TAKES 7.5 MINUTES TO REACH THE LUNAR ORBIT BUT DEPENDING ON THE METHOD USED IT TAKES 1.5 HOURS OR 3.5 HOURS TO REACH BEHIND THE CSM. 
- AGC RUNS PROGRAM #20 AT THIS TIME TO MEASURE THE STATE VECTOR OF CSM. 
- THE PILOT IN CSM TRACKS LUNAR MODULE WHOLE WAY UP TO THE ORBIT AND AGC ON CSM CALCULATES STATE VECTOR ON THE LUNAR MODULE. 
- THE LM STOPS AT 50 METRES DISTANCE FROM CSM AND ROTATES TO ALIGN THE POINT OF ATTACHMENTS OF BOTH THE MODULES. 
- AT THIS POINT CSM TAKES ROLE OF ACTIVE MODULE AND ACTIVATES PROGRAM #79 (FINAL RENDEZVOUS) TO SLOW DOWN THE CSM TO CLOSE THE DISTANCE UNTIL JOINING.
- SECONDS BEFORE THE CONTACT AUTOPILOT ON BOTH THE SPACECRAFT IS SWITCHED OFF TO AVOID BOTH TRYING TO CORRECT THE ATTITUDE OF COMBINED SPACECRAFT. 

G. EARTH TRANS INJECTION:
- WE FEED AGC WITH EARTH ORBIT PARAMETRES AND LET IT CALCULATE THE BURNS FOR CONTROL. ANY KIND OF THE CORRECTIONS ARE PERFORMED IN THE SAME WAY WHILE IT WAS DONE DURING
TRANS LUNAR INJECTION. (PROGRAM #99).
- ONCE IT IS IN THE EARTH ORBIT THE ENTRY PARAMETRES DATA IS CALCULATED IN THE GROUND AND SENT TO SPACECRAFT.
- FIRST ENTRY PROGRAM (PROGRAM #61) IS ACTIVATED ALMOST 25 MINUTES BEFORE THE ENTRY WHICH REQUESTS VARIOUS PARAMETRES LIKE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE OF SPLASH ZONE AND 
THE ANGLE TO ENTER THE ATMOSPHERE. 
- ENTERING AND CONFIRMING THIS PARAMETRES COMPLETES PROGRAM #61 AND STARTS PROGRAM #62 WHICH ASKS ASTRONAUTS TO PERFORM CHECKLIST FOR MANUAL COMMAND MODULE AND SERVICE MODULE
SEPERATION WHICH IS NOT CONTROLLED BY THE AGC. 
- AFTER THIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED, IT SWITCHES AUTOMATICALLY TO PROGRAM #63, WHICH LETS AUTOPILOT CONTROL THE THRUST OF THE COMMAND MODULE WHILE BREAKING OUT OF EARTH'S ORBIT
TO THE ATMOSPHERE.
- PROGRAM #64(MAIN PROGRAM FOR ENTRY) STARTS AUTOMATICALLY, WHICH MONITORS THE TRAJECTORY, AND SPLASH DOWN LOCATION, DETERMINES THE BEST ENTRY SOLUTION WITH POTENTIAL 
VELOCITY REDUCTION USING TWO SPECIFIC PROGRAM EITHER:
	A. PROGRAM #65 (ENTRY UP CONTROL): WHICH REDUCES THE SPEED OF THE CM FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND EXTENDS THE RANGE.
	B. PROGRAM #66 (ENTRY BALLISTIC CONTROL): WHICH THROWS CM AT THE AMOSPHERE LIKE CANNON BALL.
- THE RIGHT MIXTURE OF THE TOOLS AND LOCATION OF THE SPLASH DECIDES WHICH ONE OF THE ABOVE IS USED. 
-PROGRAM #67 BY AGC PERFORMS FINAL MANEUVER TO THE SPLASH ZONE BEFORE OPENING OF THE PARACHUTE.
-THE STEPS LIKE PARACHUTE DEPLOYMENT AND FOLLOWING ARE NOT DONE BY AGC BUT THE EARTH LANDING SEQUENCE CONTROL (ELSC).
-THE JOB OF AGC IS DONE BEFORE DEPLOYING THE PARACHUTES. 


***** 1202 ALARM DURING POWER DESCENT PHASE ON THE MOON ******
- PROGRAMS AT POWER DESCENT USES NORMALLY 85% OF PROCESSING POWER OF THE COMPUTER. 
- BUT DUE TO INCORRECT POWER SUPPLY DESIGN THE RENDEZVOUS RADAR GENERATED ADDITIONAL 12800 INVOLUNTARY INPUTS OR INSTRUCTIONS PER SECONDS WHICH AMOUNTED TO EXACT REMAINING 15%.
- THIS RESULTED IN THE BUILUP OF QUEUE OF JOBS FOR THE COMPUTER AND RESULTED IN EXECUTIVE OVERFLOW AND 1202 ALARM. 
- BUT THE OS WAS DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT PERFORMED AUTOMATIC PROGRAM ABORT DUE TO WHICH JOBS WERE CANCELLED AND RESTARTED WITHIN FEW SECONDS AND LANDING COMMENCED. 

*****APOLLO 13 ISSUE*****
- CSM EXPLODED DUE TO OXYGEN TANK LEAKAGE AROUND 55 HOURS WHICH WAS 320000 KM FROM EARTH. 
- THEY HAD TO MOVE TO LUNAR MODULE TO SURVIVE BECAUSE OF WHICH IMU (WHICH WAS VERY LESS IN LM DUE TO WEIGHT DECREASING) HAD TO BE TRANSFERRED TO LM.
- THESE MANUAL TASKS AND MID COURSE CORRECTIONS WERE DONE BY AGS ON THE LM.
- SUCESSFUL REBOOT AND CHANGES IN THE LM WAS DONE HOURS BEFORE THE REENTRY.
