*****UNUSUAL FEATURE OF AGC ARCHITECTURE WHEN COMPARED TO MODERN COMPUTERS*****

1) ONE'S COMPLEMENT IS USED FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF NEGATIVE NUMBERS INSTEAD OF TWO'S COMPLEMENT (ELABORATE ON THE PROBABLE REASONS).

2) OVERFLOW FLAG CANNOT BE SAVED, DISABLED, OR INTERRUPTED UNTIL THE OVERFLOW IS RESOLVED BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF A STATIC REGISTER REQUIRED TO DO SO.

3) STORE INSTRUCTION CAN SKIP A WORD UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE OVERFLOW. 

4) CCS INSTRUCTION CAN SKIP SEVERAL WORDS ALTOGETHER AND THIS CAN BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS WHEN THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS USE PREFIXES (LIKE EXTEND. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT PREFIX
AS IT IS CAPABLE TO CHANGE  THE MEANING OF THE OPCODE OF THE NEXT INSTRUCTION WHILE ENCODING AND IT IS THE ONLY PREFIX WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE ENCODING OF ANOTHER SET OF WORD 
INSTRUCTIONS EXCEPT PRIMARY INSTRUCTIONS). 

5) THERE ARE SPECIAL MEMORY CELLS (4 CELLS) ALLOCATED FOR THE SHIFT/ ROTATE FUNCTIONS WHICH SHIFT/ROTATE ONLY WHILE WRITING INTO THEM. THERE COULD HAVE BEEN SPECIAL INSTRUCTION
FOR SHIFT/ROTATE AND IT COULD HAVE SAVED MEMORY (WHICH WAS TOO LIMITED).

6) MOST OF THE BOOLEAN INSTRUCTIONS WORK ONLY ON THE I/O CHANNELS EXCEPT THE AND INSTRUCTION WHICH CAN WORK BETWEEN THE REGISTER (A) AND SPECIFIC MEMORY LOCATION. 

7) INDEX PREFIX OR INDEXING IN GENERAL IS DONE BY ADDING THE VALUE TO IR. THIS CAUSES AN INTERRUPT IN THE EXECUTION AS THE ALTERED IR DOES NOT MATCH THE VALUE IN THE PC.
IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT IR IS UPDATED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE PC AND CONTAINS THE VALUE OF MEMORY LOCATION IN PC. HOWEVER, INDEXING CAUSES ADDITION OF SPECIFIC VALUES TO IR 
AND CAUSE AN INTERRUPT IN THE EXECUTION. THIS IS RESOLVED BY THE IR' REGISTER WHICH STORES THE ORIGINAL IR VALUE AND RESTORES IT TO IR AFTER INDEXING TO CONTINUE THE NORMAL 
FLOW OF EXECUTION. 

8) THERE IS NOTHING LIKE STACK AVAILABLE IN THE ARCHITECTURE BECAUSE OF WHICH INDEXING IS USED AS AND WHEN NEEDED. INDEXING IS ALSO DERIVED FROM THE AVAILABLE INSTRUCTION SETS.
